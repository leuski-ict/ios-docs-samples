The screensaver runs the classic
[Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
and displays the results in a grid of hexagonal icons featuring many
Google Cloud Platform products.

The project also contains a standalone Mac app that can be used to
test the screensaver view.

## Requirements

The screensaver code is Swift 2.2 and requires Xcode 7.3.
